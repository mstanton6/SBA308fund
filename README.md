# My Application Name
-This application grades student assignments.  It reads each students records from an object. See the object below for a sample of what the object includes:

        learner_id: 125,
        assignment_id: 1,
        submission: {
            submitted_at: "2023-01-25",
            score: 47

# Special note
I took the output is literal and included what I think we supposed to be comments. So my code produced literally this format thru all coding:

        id: 125,
        avg: 0.985, // (47 + 150) / (50 + 150)
        1: 0.94, // 47 / 50
        2: 1.0 // 150 / 150
